/*The array of pixels is a 85 element long of uint_16s.
 * So how will this all work?
 * Ill tell you how this will freaking work.
 * So we are going to get the current column, the left and the right column. 
 * Using that, we are going to go through pixel by pixel, assembling a list of
 * all the pixels near the current one. 
 * We will then populate another array with the current column.
 * Or better yet, we will store the first and last column of the previous state
 * and just update it in place. */ 


/* Now for the rules of the game of life...
 * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * 
 * NOTE! All things happen simultaniously. Which means that:
 * We need to store the first, last column.
 * As we go from left to right, we need to save a copy of the column that we are
 * dealing with as it appeared before.
 * Now. Lets write some code...*/
